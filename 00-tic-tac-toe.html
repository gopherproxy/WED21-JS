	/*
	
	Stuff to handle ;-):
	1. Make the fields clickable (player0 uses "X", player1 "0")
	2. Keep track of all used fields (fieldsPlayed) and of the fields each player chose (fieldsPlayer0, fieldsPlayer1)
	3. Avoid that úsed fields can be played again and implement feedback like "Field already taken" (alert();)
	4. Check for winning combinations
	5. Implement feedback to the players (winning or game is a draw)
	6. End the game, avoid further playing
	7. Add a "Play again button"
	8. Implement "eternal" game statistics (using local storage!)
	9. Style the game as fancy and responsive as you can ;-)
